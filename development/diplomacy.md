<h3>Conducting yourself</h3>
<p>A big part of micronationalism is simulation. Even if you are a secessionist, simulation is still a big part of you and your micronation. It is especially important to remember this in foreign affairs. Conduct yourself in diplomacy as you would if you were representing a 'proper' nation-state (i.e.  a 'macronation').</p>
<p>This means speak tactfully, use formality and use your comments wisely. There are people out there who deliberatly try to provoke you into a certain reaction (otherwise known as 'trolling' or 'flaming'). That is the type of situation where you must choose your comments wisely, if you make any comment at all.</p>
<h3>Seeking diplomatic relations</h3>
<p>When you have first dipped your toes into foreign affairs, your first acts will probably be to establish formal diplomatic relations with as many micronations as possible. This is a good way of getting into contact with other micronations, but be aware that some micronations do not recognise micronations that they consider to be "inferior" or different to them. Research these sorts of things beforehand.</p>
<p>Different communities have different ways of going about doing this as well as different attitudes. Some communities take diplomatic relations quite seriously, and will often involved some form of written agreement or treaty. Other communities barely bother with it at all, considering it a formality that they can't be bothered with. Again, do your research beforehand.</p>
<p>When seeking diplomatic relations, remember that you are representing your nation. Thus, you are an important part of your nation's image. If you come across as immature and annoying, then nobody will want to do business with you. If you come across as mature and at least mildly respectable, then people are much more likely to accept your requests and hold you in higher standing.</p>
