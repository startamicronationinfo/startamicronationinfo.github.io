<h3>The Internet</h3>
<p>What you will need is a website. If you're starting afresh and want the easiest and cheapest way to make a presence for your micronation online, your best bet is to go with a free website provider like <a href="http://www.webs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freewebs</a> or <a href="http://www.yola.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yola</a>. They're easy to build and come with many useful functions.</p>
<p>When you build your website, try modelling it on existing and well-established micronations. The resources page may provide you with some starting points in that regard.</p>
<p>Depending on whether you think you will need one for your micronation, it may also be a good idea to create a forum. Again, there are many good free hosting providers, such as <a href="http://www.forumotion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forumotion</a> and <a href="http://www.proboards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proboards</a>. Your forum is a good central meeting point for your citizens and for you to conduct the affairs of your micronation. These 'forum farms' are the easiest ways to go, but if you want my advice, it's not the best way to go. Read on to find out more...</p>

<h3>Your own hosting</h3>
<p>It is possible to get half-decent hosting totally free, contrary to popular belief.</p>
<p>There are a few good free hosting providers, such as <a href="http://x10hosting.com/">X10 Hosting</a>. The main advantage of not relying on 'farm' websites like Forumer and Proboards is that you control your information. With the 'farm' websites, they have control over your data and databases and more often than not will not allow you to access them at all.</p>
<p>After you get your hosting, you will need a domain name. My personal recommendation is that you buy one - it's very inexpensive. A .com domain name will set you back only about $10-11 a year. Many registrars exist, but I personally recommend <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. I've bought quite a few domain names with them and have never been disappointed with prices or service. They also have monthly discount vouchers which can save you quite a bit of money.</p>
<p>However, if you don't want to buy your own domain name, <a href="http://www.dot.tk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dot.tk</a> is probably your best bet. Many micronations use .co.cc domain names, but fail to recognise the catch. After one year, you have to pay to keep your domain name, or it goes inactive. Changing domain names is never good, so if you're looking for a totally free way to set up your websites, .co.cc is not the best way to go.</p>
<p>Lastly, you're going to need some sort of website builder or CMS, unless you have coding experience. Even then, this still might be useful. Personally, I cannot recommend <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wordpress</a> highly enough. It's simple and easy to use, but powerful. There are also many thousands of different themes and plugins available around the Internet, which you can also modify to your own needs if you wish. However, if you do not wish to use Wordpress, many other alternatives exist, such as <a href="http://www.joomla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joomla</a>.</p>
