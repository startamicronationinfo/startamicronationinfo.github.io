<p>Well you've made it this far...</p>

<p>You can go it alone in micronationalism, but let's face it, it's not that much fun. A large part of micronationalism is about interaction and simulation, which also happens to be rather fun at the same time.</p>
<p>The most common and easy way to get people involved is start with your family and friends. They're people you know already and in all likelihood, at least one of them will be interested and join you in your new adventure (maybe even tempt them with a knighthood or two). There's also the possibility that they'll pass on information about your micronation to others via word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>A common mistake that new micronations make is trying to recruit new citizens from existing micronations or from the internet. One problem with this is that other micronations don't take too kindly to other people pinching their citizens and as we will see later, diplomacy is a big part of micronationalism. Another problem with that is that the target market is very small. There are next to no people out there who are involved in micronationalism and don't have citizenship of a micronation. Those who do are usually 'freelance micronationalists' who don't have citizenship because that's the way they want it.</p>
<h3>The Internet</h3>
<p>In the past ten years or so, the internet has become one of the most important factors in modern micronationalism. It's how people communicate and promote their micronations.</p>
