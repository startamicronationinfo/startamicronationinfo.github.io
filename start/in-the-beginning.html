<p>Now, you've decided that you want to start a micronation. Where next? Well a good place to start is to know exactly what a micronation is. This is a good start:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Micronations are entities that may claim to be independent nations or states or attempt to simulate 'real world' politics but which are not recognised by world governments, nation-states or major international organisations. These nations often exist only on paper, on the Internet, or in the minds of their creators. There are, however, important exceptions to this, being fully territorial and exercising limited sovereignty over a very small area, such as the Principality of Sealand"</em></p>
<p>Many definitions exist, but that one gives you the basic gist of it.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-69" title="sealand" src="http://startamicronation.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sealand-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="114" />What do you want to achieve?</h3>
<p>This is the most important question that you must answer to yourself before you start anything.</p>
<p>Essentially, why are you starting a micronation? Is it a protest? A hobby? A group of friends? Rebellion against your parents?</p>
<p>Once you answer this question, you can then decide what type of micronation you establish. Which is a nice segue into the next topic...</p>
<h3>Types of micronation</h3>
<p>Micronations may be generally sorted into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Social, economic, or political simulations.</li>
<li>Historical simulations.</li>
<li>Exercises in personal entertainment or self-aggrandisement.</li>
<li>Exercises in fantasy, creative fiction or artistic expression.</li>
<li>Vehicles for the promotion of an agenda.</li>
<li>Entities created for fraudulent purposes.</li>
<li>Historical anomalies and aspirant states.</li>
<li>Exercises in historical revisionism.</li>
<li>New-country projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>These categories are by no means universally accepted or used, but it's good enough for our purposes here.</p>
<p>I could explain each category, but that would take too long and would probably bore you out. Besides, their titles are pretty self-explanitory. Anyway, if you want to know about categorising micronations, <a href="http://mw.micronation.org/wiki/Micronation#Categories_of_micronations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this is a good place to start</a>.</p>
<h3>Choose your government<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-71" title="government" src="http://startamicronation.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/government-300x289.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="130" /></h3>
<p>There are many hundreds of types of government, ranging from democracy to anarcho-capitalism. Your job is to choose what you think is best for your micronation.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, the most common form of micronational government is monarchy. This is essentially some sort of king, queen, czar, etc. ruling over a micronation having all 'sovereign' power vested in them. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to follow the crowd. In fact, many micronations change government types and even experiment with different types of government to see which ones work and which ones don't.</p>
